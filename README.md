# Handsomest Nerd Inc. Multi-Agent Network (THN-MAN)

Welcome to the Handsomest Nerd Inc. Multi-Agent Agile Development System!

This platform leverages specialized AI agents, each modeled after a classic Agile team role, to automate and accelerate the delivery of high-quality software‚Äîstarting with our flagship Agile Ceremonies application and its Pair Programming Widget.

## üöÄ Project Overview

Agile Ceremonies streamlines Agile practices with special attention to pair programming. Our system combines eight core agents (plus support staff) to cover every product and devops lifecycle stage.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Agent Directory

| Agent | Role | Main Responsibilities |
|-------|------|----------------------|
| Nat | CEO / AI PM | Project lead, overall strategy, system access, final decisions |
| Brian | Product Manager | Owns Pair Programming Widget, backlog/feature coordination |
| Reqqy | Requirements Agent | Gathers/structures requirements; GitHub issue integration |
| Josh | Graphic Design | UI/UX mockups, branding, visual media assets |
| James & Terrell | Twin Dev Agents | Pair programming, build features, write/maintain code |
| Antosh | Testing & Analytics | TDD, QA coverage, metrics, performance tracking |
| Man-Man | Maintenance Agent / DevOps | Deployed app upkeep, infrastructure, Firebase Ops & audio file transcription |
| Lia | Email & Social Media | Growth, mail campaigns, social content, user comms |
| Compass | HR Agent & Message Router | Support, workflow routing, prompt/agent recommendation, logs |

## üóÇÔ∏è How It Works

### Core Collaboration Model

- Each agent is specialized and only acts on discrete, authorized requests.
- Compass routes all tasks to the appropriate agent(s), ensuring smooth automated workflows.
- Workflows are approved before execution‚Äîno unattended automation!

### Workflow Overview

1. You submit a request‚Äîeither a general help-desk/support need or a technical/project workflow query.
2. Compass analyzes the request, matches it to relevant agent(s), and drafts a workflow plan.
3. Compass returns a step-by-step plan: which agents to call on, which prompts/tools to use, and expected outputs.
4. On approval, Compass routes each workflow step to the specified agent.
5. All activity is logged for transparency and iterative improvement.


## üß≠ The Role of Compass (You're Here!)

- **Smart Hub**: Receives all requests for agent action or information
- **Routing**: Reads each prompt, identifies the best-fit agent(s), creates actionable workflows, and returns plans for approval
- **Help Desk**: Explains agent abilities, company info, tool inventory; logs and handles requests
- **Adaptive**: Continuously refines routes using feedback and logged results

## üõ†Ô∏è Data & Communication

- **Firestore-style storage**: Agents, workflows, logs, prompts, tools, and feedback all stored in organized collections
- **Communication Protocol**:
    - Requests: JSON with systemPrompt and userPrompt
    - Plans: JSON workflow (see above)
    - Logs: All agent actions and messages for transparency and troubleshooting

## ‚òéÔ∏è Need Help?

Submit your request (project, workflow, documentation, troubleshooting, or general help-desk needs)‚ÄîCompass will:

1. Identify the best agent(s) and workflow for you.
2. Return a step-by-step plan for your approval.
3. Route and track execution, keeping you in the loop at every step.

## üìù Contributing & Extending

- Add new Agents: Extend the agent directory and register their tools and workflow triggers.
- Add new Workflows: Define the sequence, agent assignments, and new workflow IDs.
- Extend the Workflow & Prompt Library: Grow the set of reusable components and prompt templates.
- Log feedback and errors for continual Compass improvement!
