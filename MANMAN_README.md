### Step-by-Step Workflow Walkthrough

1. User provides the requested Firestore operation (Create, Modify, or Delete), the collection (and optionally document) path, andâ€”for create/modifyâ€”an optional data payload.
2. Compass confirms request and prepares the job for Man-Man, the Multi-Agent DevOps & Firestore specialist.
3. Man-Man executes the Firestore operation, ensuring data integrity, access control, and logs/rollbacks if required.
4. Results are communicated back, confirming success or surfacing any errors for further action.

## How this fits into your workflow

- One interaction: You define the operation, path, and data.
- Zero hassle: Man-Man ensures compliance, stability, and logs everything for your audit trail.
- Growth-ready: Expand to bulk operations, backup, restoration, or analyticsâ€”all through the same agent.
